    <title>Paul Diem - Bio</title>
</head>

<body>
    My name is Paul Diem. My major is currently undeclared as I want to explore the different paths available to me, but I am very interested in anything that allows me to work with computers. I graduated high school with several awards tied to high grades and test scores for different classes, and I have a year of experience in coding with Swift. In my free time, I like to play video games and make music. My family moved to New York from Minnesota in 2017 after my father was accepted for the position of SUâ€™s Director of Athletic Bands.
