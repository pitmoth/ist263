    <h1>Paul Diem/s Biography</h1>

    <p>
        My name is Paul Diem. My major is currently undeclared as I want to explore the different paths available to me, but I am very interested in anything that allows me to work with computers.
    </p>

    <p>
        I graduated high school with several awards tied to high grades and test scores for different classes, and I have a year of experience in coding with <strong>Swift</strong>.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
   
    <p>
        There are a few ways I like to spend my free time:<br>
        <dl>
            
            <dt>Video Games</dt>
            <dd>I most commonly enjoy singleplayer games, but I prefer co-op over competitive when I do play with others.</dd>
            <dt>Music</dt>
            <dd>Music has always been an important part of my life, so I like to play it myself once in a while. I know how to play the French horn as well as the piano, and i also enjoy singing.</dd>
            <dt>Pets</dt>
            <dd>My family owns two cats and a dog, all of which can be quite energetic at times. They are always fun to spend time around, though they sometimes play fight a little too hard for my liking.</dd>

        </dl>
        I live at home with the rest of my immediate family since we are quite close to the university. My family moved to New York from Minnesota in 2017 after my father was accepted for the position of SUâ€™s Director of Athletic Bands.
